    <div class="container">
        <p>
            I am Keith Seruyange, an aspiring GIS Developer with a strong foundation in spatial analysis, data
            interpretation, and digital mapping. Currently advancing my skills at Refactory Academy, I am passionate
            about using geospatial technologies to solve real-world problems and support data-driven decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
            My academic journey has equipped me with a solid understanding of geographic information systems, Python
            programming, and data visualization. I am particularly interested in how GIS can be applied to urban
            planning, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure development areas where spatial insight can drive
            meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of the tech space, I am deeply involved in rugby as both a player and assistant coach with the KOBs
            Rugby Club. Rugby has taught me discipline, strategic thinking, and the value of teamwork qualities I
            bring into every professional setting. Whether I am leading on the field or collaborating on a project, I
            approach challenges with focus, resilience, and a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am excited to contribute to innovative GIS projects, continue learning, and connect with professionals who
            share a passion for spatial intelligence and community development.
        </p>
