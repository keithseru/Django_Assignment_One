# Django_Assignment_One
Django Portfolio Assessment

For this assessment, you'll create a single Django application to manage a simple personal portfolio. This project will demonstrate your understanding of fundamental Django concepts, including virtual environments, Django projects and apps, URLs, views, and templates.
Project Requirements

1. Virtual Environment:
  Set up a dedicated Python virtual environment for your project.

2. Django Project and App:
  Create a new Django project and a single Django application within it.

3. Pages and URLs:
  Your portfolio should include three distinct pages, each with its own URL and corresponding view:
      About Me: A page that provides a brief introduction about you.
      Education: A page that lists your educational background.
      Contact: A page with information on how to contact you. It should have a form that collects the name, email and message. Show a thank you message using a context once a user fills in the contact form.  

4. Views:
Create a Django view for each of the three pages. These views should render the correct HTML templates.

5. Templates:
Create a separate HTML template for each of the three pages. Use a home template (home.html) as your main landing page. All pages should have navigation between each other via a top bar.

SUBMISSION
1. GitHub Repository:
  Publish your completed Django project to a public GitHub repository.
2. Submit Link:
  Share the link to your public GitHub repository as your submission.
Good luck!
